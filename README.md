# I310D-Data-Curation-and-Analysis
This is part of an assignment for my I310D class.

This is a short assignment project from my class I310D Intro to Human-Centered Data Science at The University of Texas at Austin. The goal of this was to scrape data from a CNN website list of Fortune500 companies and some associated data points. I thought it would be interesting to try and find relationships between company attributes and their ranking on the Fortune500 list.
